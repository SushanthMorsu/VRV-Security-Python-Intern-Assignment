# VRV-Security-Python-Intern-Assignment

## Description
This Python script processes log files to extract and analyze key information. It is designed to handle tasks essential for cybersecurity-related programming, including:

- **Counting Requests per IP Address**: Parses log files to calculate the number of requests made by each IP address.
- **Identifying the Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint**: Extracts the endpoint accessed the highest number of times.
- **Detecting Suspicious Activity**: Flags IP addresses with failed login attempts exceeding a configurable threshold.
- **Outputting Results**: Displays results in the terminal and saves them to a structured CSV file.
